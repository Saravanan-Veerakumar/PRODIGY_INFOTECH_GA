# PRODIGY_INFOTECH_GA
This repository contains project files and resources developed during my Generative AI Internship at Prodigy Infotech, which took place from October 1, 2024, to October 31, 2024. Throughout this internship, I focused on various generative AI applications.
# Projects Included
**1. Neural Style Transfer:** Implemented neural style transfer to apply artistic styles to images by leveraging deep neural networks.

**2. GPT-2 Text Generation for Medical Billing:** Fine-tuned GPT-2 to generate ICD-10 and CPT codes based on clinical notes, exploring generative AI applications in healthcare.

**3. Image Generation with Pre-trained Models:** Experimented with pre-trained image generation models to produce original visuals, focusing on model customization and adaptation.

**4. Text Generation with Markov Chains:** Developed a text generator using Markov Chains, generating coherent text based on trained patterns.
